  Although it is a fact that social media acts as an sophisticated electronic journal in documenting people’s life, it is quite shocking and surprising to see how people can vent out almost all of their emotions in a public forum. These emotions include but not limited to, love, hatred, vengeance, jealous, happiness, sadness, anxiety, depression, etc., The reason behind sharing this on forums can vary from mere attention seeking to being less judged by the society. Regardless of the reason and the type of emotion, social media posts are becoming one of the most powerful sources of data that could unfold powerful insights. As on 2020, 3.6 million social media users recorded in New Zealand [1] which is more than 70% of the entire population. Without doubt, the youth population contributes the most. Sadly, at the same time, UNICEF reports that New Zealand ranks second worst in youth suicide rate among the developed nations [2]. The same fact was also confirmed by WHO, which identifies “self-harm” as one of the Top 3 reason for death in the population aged from 10-50 [3]. Although some cases of suicide are spontaneous, most of the suicides are result of chronic of depression and anxiety. The aim is to envisage the social media posts that features depression, anxiety and suicidal contents either explicitly or implicitly by using Natural Language Processing.
